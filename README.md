# Andrew-Ng-Machine-Learning-Assignment
These are my solutions for assignments of Stanford Introduction To Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng. This repository includes solutions for assignments of all weeks through 3 to 7.

It also includes vectorized implementations for most of the problems, however the optional exercises are still somewhat incomplete. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
